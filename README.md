# Shopping Cart Application

This is a simple shopping cart application built using Vue.js, TypeScript, Vee Validate, Zod, and other libraries. It allows users to set a budget, add items to their cart, and see the remaining budget after each purchase. I just decided to test my vue js skills

- Add items to the shopping cart.
